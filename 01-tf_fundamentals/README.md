`If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that.` - Rule 1 of [Google's Maching Learning Hanfbook](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml)

# Machine Learning and Deep Learning

- **Machine learning** is turning data into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers. 
- **Deep Learning:** A type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks (ANN's) in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher features from data.

### Traditional Programming

- inputs -> rules -> `Output`

### Machine Learning Algorithms

- inputs -> output -> `Rules`

## Why use Machine Learning or Deep Learning?

- ML can be used for literally any problem solving task `as long as you can convert the inputs to numbers` and program it to find patterns. Literally it could be anything, any input or output from the universe (Kulshreshtha, 2020)

## What deep learning is not good for

- When the traditional approach is better option - Rule 1
- When you need explainability - the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by humans
- When errors are unacceptable - ML algorithms have errors
- When you don't have much data 

## What are neural networks?

Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (or neurons) that work together to process data and learn patterns.
