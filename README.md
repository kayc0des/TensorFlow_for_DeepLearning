### 1 — Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow

- **Build TensorFlow sequential models** with multiple layers
- **Prepare data** for use with a machine learning model
- Learn the **different components** of a deep learning model (loss function, architecture, optimization function)
- **Diagnose a regression problem** (predicting a number) and build a neural network for it

### 2 — Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow

- **Diagnose a classification problem** (predicting whether something is one thing or another)
- **Build, compile & train** machine learning classification models using TensorFlow
- Build and train models for **binary and multi-class classification**
- **Plot modeling performance metrics** against each other
- **Match input (training data shape) and output shapes** (prediction data target)

### 3 — Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow

- Build **convolutional neural networks** with Conv2D and pooling layers
- **Diagnose different kinds of computer vision problems**
- **Build computer vision neural networks**
- **Use real-world images** with your computer vision models

### 4 — Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 1: Feature Extraction

- **Use pre-trained models** to extract features from your own data
- **Use TensorFlow Hub** for pre-trained models
- **Use TensorBoard** to compare the performance of several different models

### 5 — Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 2: Fine-tuning

- **Setup and run several machine learning experiments**
- **Use data augmentation** to increase the diversity of your training data
- **Fine-tune a pre-trained model** to your own custom problem
- **Use Callbacks** to add functionality to your model during training

### 6 — Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 3: Scaling Up (Food Vision mini)

- **Scale up an existing model**
- **Evaluate your machine learning models** by finding the most wrong predictions
- **Beat the original Food101 paper** using only 10% of the data

### 7 — Milestone Project 1: Food Vision

Combine everything you've learned in the previous 6 modules to build **Food Vision**: a computer vision model able to classify 101 different kinds of foods. Our model well and truly beats the original Food101 paper.

### 8 — NLP Fundamentals in TensorFlow

Learn to:
- **Preprocess natural language text** to be used with a neural network
- **Create word embeddings** (numerical representations of text) with TensorFlow
- **Build neural networks** capable of binary and multi-class classification using:
  - RNNs (recurrent neural networks)
  - LSTMs (long short-term memory cells)
  - GRUs (gated recurrent units)
  - CNNs
- **Evaluate your NLP models**

### 9 — Milestone Project 2: SkimLit

Replicate the model which powers the PubMed 200k paper to classify different sequences in PubMed medical abstracts (which can help researchers read through medical abstracts faster).

### 10 — Time Series Fundamentals in TensorFlow

- **Diagnose a time series problem** (building a model to make predictions based on data across time, e.g., predicting the stock price of AAPL tomorrow)
- **Prepare data for time series neural networks** (features and labels)
- **Understand and use different time series evaluation methods**
  - MAE — mean absolute error
- **Build time series forecasting models** with TensorFlow
  - RNNs (recurrent neural networks)
  - CNNs (convolutional neural networks)

### 11 — Milestone Project 3: (Surprise)

If you've read this far, you are probably interested in the course. This last project will be good... we promise you, so see you inside the course ;)
